## Goal:

This project aims to make a image classification model that can determine if an image contains a cat or a dog.

## About the data

This dataset was taken from an old kaggle competition that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). The images are from an old CAPTCHA known as *Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access* (or *Asirra* for short) which asked the user to identify whether or not several images displayed contained either a cat or a dog.

There are 25,000 images total evenly split between cats(0) and dogs(1).
